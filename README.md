# ðŸš€ Turborepo starter

One of the challenges of building microfrontends is dependency management and build systems. In the packages and apps in this monorepo, we'll be using Turborepo to earn great developer experience for our teams with minimal configuration.

## ðŸ”¨ Prerequisites

    git --version
    # >= 2.40.1
    node --version
    # >= v16.0.0
    pnpm --version
    # >= 8.6.0

## âœ¨ Features

- Everything is in TypeScript
- Next.js is used for the applications in ./apps
- Shared packages used by the apps in ./packages
- Tailwind CSS for utility CSS in React components and to build the design system
- Storybook is used for the components that are part of the hros-ui package and its setup is shared in the storybook package
- The ESLint config lives in custom-eslint-config
- Bundle your TypeScript library with no config
